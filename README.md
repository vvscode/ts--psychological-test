This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Test project (Psychological Test App)

The goal is firstly for us to get a better understanding of how you structure your code and secondly to hear how you explain it.

We canâ€™t wait to see how you will tackle it ðŸ˜Š

Your assignment:

- Build a simple personality test application, that takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.
- You can find examples of questions here: https://www.psychologies.co.uk/self/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert.html

An example could be

- Landing screen
- Start personality test
- Dynamic screen, that reads question and answers from a the backend (Just build CRUD, with in memory DB)
- Finish screen, where you can see your personality trait.

It is a plus if you write some unit-tests.
